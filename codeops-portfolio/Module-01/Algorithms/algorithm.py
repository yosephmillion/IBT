#Question 1 
#Given an array of numbers, write a function that prints in the console another arraywhich contains all the even numbers in the original array, which also have even indexes only.
      #○ Test 1: getOnlyEvens([1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8]) prints [ 4]
      #○ Test 2: getOnlyEvens([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) prints [0, 2, 4]

def get_only_evens(arr):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(arr), 2):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0:
            result.append(arr[i])
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_only_evens([1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8])
    get_only_evens([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

#Question 2
#● Create a function that takes a two-digit number as an parameter and prints "Ok" inthe console if the given string is greater than its reversed digit version. If not, the function will print "Not ok"
     #○ Test 1: reverseCompare(72) prints "ok" because 72 > 27
     #○ reverseCompare(23) prints "Not ok", because 23 is not greater than 32

def reverseCompare(num):
    reversed_num = int(str(num)[::-1])
    
    if num > reversed_num:
        print("Ok")
    else:
        print("Not ok")

#Question 3
#● Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the factorial of the number. Notes: The factorial of 0 is 1. Ex: factorial seven is : 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7. The factorial of any positive integer x is x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) * . . . . . . * 1 (ex: factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24)
    #○ Test 1: returnFactorial(5) outputs 120
    #○ Test 2: returnFactorial(6) outputs 720
    #○ Test 3: returnFactorial(0) outputs 1


def returnFactorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
        
    return result

#Question 4 (Meera array)
#● A Meera array is defined to be an array containing only numbers as its elements and forall n values in the array, the value n*2 is not in the array. So [3, 5, -2] is a Meera array because 3*2, 5*2 or 2*2 are not in the array. But [8, 3, 4] is not a Meera array because 2*4=8 and both 4 and 8 are elements found in the array. Write a function that takes an array of numbered elements and prints “I am a Meera array” in the console if its array does NOT contain n and also n*2 as value. Otherwise, the function prints “I am NOT a Meera array”
      #○ Test 1: checkMeera([10, 4, 0, 5]) outputs “I am NOT a Meera array” because 5 * 2 is 10
      #○ Test 2: checkMeera([7, 4, 9]) outputs “I am a Meera array”
      #○ Test 1: checkMeera([1, -6, 4, -3]) outputs “I am NOT a Meera array” because -3 *2 is -6

def checkMeera(arr):
    arr_set = set(arr)
    
    for n in arr:
        if n * 2 in arr_set:
            print("I am NOT a Meera array")
            return
            
    print("I am a Meera array")

#Question 5 (Dual array)
# ● Define a Dual array to be an array where every value occurs exactly twice. For example, {1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2} is a dual array.The following arrays are not Dual arrays {2, 5, 2, 5, 5} (5 occurs three times instead of two times) {3, 1, 1, 2, 2} (3 occurs once instead of two times) 
# Write a function named isDual that returns 1 if its array argument is a Dual array. Otherwise it returns 0.


def isDual(arr):
    if len(arr) % 2 != 0:
        return 0
        
    counts = {}
    for num in arr:
        counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1
    for count in counts.values():
        if count != 2:
            return 0
            
    return 1

#Question 6
#● Write a function that takes the number of seconds and returns the digital format clock time as a string. Time should be counted from 00:00:00.
    #  ○ Examples: digitalClock(5025) as "01:23:45" 5025 seconds is 1 hour, 23 mins, 45secs.
    #  ■ digitalClock(61201) as "17:00:01" No AM/PM. 24h format.
    #  ■ digitalClock(87000) as "00:10:00" It's 00:10 next day.

def digitalClock(seconds):
    seconds = seconds % 86400
    
    hours = seconds // 3600
    minutes = (seconds % 3600) // 60
    secs = seconds % 60
    
    return f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{secs:02d}"
